QGIS Web Client 2 Components
============================

QGIS Web Client 2 (QWC2) is a modular next generation responsive web client for QGIS Server, built with ReactJS and OpenLayers.

This repository contains the common QWC2 application components from which you can build your own personal QWC2 application.

See:
* [qwc2-demo-app](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app) for an example application built on top of the QWC2 components.
* [qwc-docker](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-docker) for QWC2 extended with microservices.
* [this presentation](https://blog.sourcepole.ch/assets/2019/qwc2-foss4g19.pdf) for an overview and architecture of QWC2.
